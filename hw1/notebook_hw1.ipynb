What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this project.I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been good.

We've had three meetings which brought out very different issues from different traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to be outside the scope of position consolidation.Things left to do:I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this project.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this project and which fall out of scope.For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and work with traders to define the exact requirements of each.Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all drill downs.Use the above to formulate a project plan.Things requested thus far (no particular order):Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal ticker.Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that add up existing position manager rows/columns).New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, transport, swaps, options, ...Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values of all curves on which the desk has a position.Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the appropriate positions to show for each:Gas Daily for monthly index,Physical gas for Nymex,Physical gas for Inside Ferc,Physical gas for Mid market.Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of using official valuations.Position and P&amp;L aggregation across all gas desks.Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS:Inclusion of spread options in our systems.

Crocker\" &lt;clclegal2@aol.com&gt; Subject: Investment StructureSTRUCTURE:Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries theliability of construction.LAND OWNERSHIP &amp; LOANSThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership andany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be inthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors andall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee theloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profitsis reduced.All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, arefull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse.USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENTThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &amp;architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlikemany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees toCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred overthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimatedmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds.The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint.CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans forpre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  willbe from 80% to 95% of value.DISBURSEMENTSDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current andnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partnerwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and thefee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, orcannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake thisfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not ownany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.REPORTINGWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet basedreporting.BOOKKEEPINGI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, \"Bookkeepingprocedures to record actual expenses?\"  Please expand.INVESTOR INPUTWe are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As alwaysthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in myexperience I have always been able to reach consensus.

We've had three meetings which brought out very different issues from different traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to be outside the scope of position consolidation.Things left to do:I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this project.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this project and which fall out of scope.For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and work with traders to define the exact requirements of each.Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all drill downs.Use the above to formulate a project plan.Things requested thus far (no particular order):Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal ticker.Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that add up existing position manager rows/columns).New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, transport, swaps, options, ...Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values of all curves on which the desk has a position.Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the appropriate positions to show for each:Gas Daily for monthly index,Physical gas for Nymex,Physical gas for Inside Ferc,Physical gas for Mid market.Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of using official valuations.Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks.Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS:Inclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility skew and correlations.Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.  Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a gamma grid.Valuation of Gas Daily options.A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD.Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets.Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position manager.Ability to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker.  Show new deal terms, prior deal terms, and net P&L affect of the change.Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker.Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of individual deals on the position total in a grid cell.Benchmark positions in TDS.Deployment of TDS in Canada. Currency and volume uom conversions. Implicit and explicit position break out issues.-- Allan.PS: Colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for transport.

Crocker\" <clclegal2@aol.com> Subject: Investment StructureSTRUCTURE:Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries theliability of construction.LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANSThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership andany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be inthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors andall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee theloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profitsis reduced.All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, arefull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse.USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENTThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlikemany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees toCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred overthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimatedmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds.The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint.CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans forpre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  willbe from 80% to 95% of value.DISBURSEMENTSDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current andnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partnerwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and thefee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, orcannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake thisfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not ownany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.REPORTINGWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.What did you have in mind?

The FERC has made itclear that ISO does not have the ability to mandate that generators sell to ISO at its price caps and that the proper response to inadequate supply is to lift the price caps.On Friday, the FERC issued its Order on Complaint in connection with the July 10 complaint filed by Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. (\"MS\").  As you may recall, MS requested FERC to issue a stay of the ISO's maximum purchase price authority and to direct the ISO to reverse any price cap reductions.  MS sought Fast Track processing pursuant to Rule 206(h), which was granted by FERC on the grounds that the complaint \"warrants expeditious action.\"As a quick background summary for you, last November, FERC issued an order approving Tariff Amendment 21 which extended ISO's price cap authority through 11/15/00.  That order stated that the ISO \"maximum purchase price was not a cap on what the seller may charge the ISO, but a cap on what the ISO was willing to pay.\"  The Commission said that sellers dissatisfied with the price cap could \"choose to sell those services into the California Power Exchange or bilateral markets.\"FERC notes in Friday's Order that the 6/28 the ISO's Board resolution lowered the caps to $500 and ISO further directed that, \"To the extent permitted by law, regulation and pre-existing contract, Management shall direct generators to bid in all their capacity when system load exceeds 38,000 MW.\"The MS complaint alleged that the cap reduction was unlawful and would, \"threaten the stability and integroty of the marketplace.\"  MS also requested an emergency technical conference to examine ISO's justification for the price cap reduction.FERC denied the MS stay request, as well as its request that the $750 maximum purchase price be reinstated.  The Commission reiterates that it is not approving a cap on sellers' prices, because they can sell at whatever price they want.  Rather ISO has simply stated the maximum price it is willing to pay.  \"Because sellers are not required to sell to the ISO, the ISO cannot dictate their price.\"Importantly, however, FERC also states that, \"ISO has no more or less ability to procure capacity and energy than any other buyer of these services....if the ISO is unable to elicit sufficient supplies at or below its announced purchase price ceiling (because generators are free to sell elsewhere if they choose), it will have to raise its purchase price to the level necessary to meet its needs.\"  [Emphasis added]  FERC then notes that this may lead to an increase in Out of Market (\"OOM\") calls and that OOM calls are not subject to a maximum purchase price.Also, with regard to the ISO's resolution stating that generators must bid their capacity into the ISO markets when system load exceeds 38,000 MW, FERC states clearly that, \"such a requirement is not permitted by our November  12 Order and the ISO tariff.\"  [Emphasis added]FERC goes on to say that any requirement to sell to ISO in conjunction with a maximum purchase price would require significant revisions to ISO's market rules, which could not be made effective without a corresponding amendment to ISO's tariff.  This would require 60 days' advance notice, \"and could not be implemented prior to Commission approval.  As stated above, our November 12 Order was clearly based on the premise that the proper response to inadequate supply (due to a low maximum purchase price) is to raise the maximum purchase price.\"ISO is then \"put on notice that any amendment to mandate sales must be accompanied by a demonstration that this extreme measure is the proper response to low supplies in the ISO markets.\"Concurrences were filed by Commissioners Massey and Hebert.  Massey suggests that the state has to facilitate solutions to market issues, such as risk management tools, removing constraints on hedging opportunities, introducing real time pricing through real time metering and expediting approval of new generation and transmission projects in California.  Hebert says that the previous November Order tried to \"straddle the fence\" and that, \"Today, the Commission at least starts to lean slightly in the right direction of recognizing that we have a role.\"  He then reiterates his preference for removing all price caps.  He also suggests that, \"Getting to the bottom of the problem, in my view, requires us to begin a proceeding to rescind our approval of the ISO as operator of the California grid.  The record supports such a move.\"  He refers approvingly to the Collins resignation letter, stating that it, \"thoughtfully outlines consequences to the market of a return to 'command and control.' \"  Hebert states that, \"The independence of the ISO's governing structure stands threatened.  We should 'stand up,' to quote the resignation letter.\"  Hebert advocates opening a section 206 proceeding now, as part of the recently announced inquiry into bulk power markets, \"including the California markets.\"This decision makes it clear that ISO cannot lower the caps at tomorrow's meeting and expect that sellers will be required to sell to it at that price.  This is an important development and very good news in our ongoing efforts to seek economic sanity at the ISO.Please call if you have any questions.Dan\n",

City Council soon will receive the contract for its approval. The administration of Mayor Lee Brown was believed to have favored Montgomery Watson's chief competitor, Azurix Corp., an arm of local energy giant Enron Corp. The water corporation, known as \"the Hawk,\" voted 5-0 to grant the contract. If approved by City Council, the contract would give the company 2 1/2 years to get the plant up and treating raw lake water. It was initially expected that the plant, which will be designed to handle 40 million gallons of water daily, could cost as much as $150 million to build. The Hawk board asked the vying companies to modify their bids several times, and that caused the competitors to lower their prices. The contract calls for the Hawk to pay a monthly operating fee of $157,000 when the plant is working. And Montgomery Watson could be required to construct, at the Hawk's option, an additional 40 million-gallon-a-day plant expansion for $32 million. But the details of how the plant will be financed have not been determined. The Hawk board discussed borrowing money using the city's credit rating on a short-term basis until it could develop long-term financing by selling bonds itself. The initial customer for the water is the city of Houston, which would repay the Hawk the cost of producing the treated water. The hope is that the plant eventually will provide water to other entities in the area as well. This plant is part of an area plan for the treatment of surface water that could cost about $2 billion to implement. City Councilman Carroll Robinson, who heads the council infrastructure committee, said he expects to hold two hearings about the contract. One would focus on how the Hawk board picked Montgomery Watson. A series of three recommendations from City Hall staff recommended Azurix. Hawk board members said Montgomery Watson's prices were lower by millions and that Azurix plans to sell Azurix North America, the body that would oversee this contract. The second City Council hearing will focus on financing, Robinson said. \"In my mind, how the city will pay for this construction is as important as who will do it,\" Robinson said. The Hawk board, appointed by Brown and approved by City Council, has been heavily lobbied by the contenders for the job. Because City Council does not have to follow the Hawk recommendation, new pressure has begun at City Hall. The third bidder, U.S. Filter Operating Services, part of a French company, has been heavily lobbying some council members to switch the contract to it. Some members of the Azurix team -- people at companies that would have gotten work had Azurix gotten the job -- have written letters complaining about the Hawk procedures as well. John M. Stokes, president and chief executive officer of Azurix, penned the first such distressed missive. In April, he wrote to Hawk board Chairman David Berg complaining of the \"deleterious economic effect\" on Azurix of the board's decision to negotiate with Montgomery Watson. He requested that Berg answer a series of questions in writing explaining why Azurix didn't get the job. Berg didn't do so. Although that letter had a threatening tone, Amanda Martin, president of Azurix North America, said no threat was intended and the letter simply indicated how upset the team was when it first learned Azurix wasn't chosen. Azurix was the rumored front-runner for months. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tINTERNATIONAL ECONOMY: Enron may cut stake in Gulf gas project Financial Times; May 15, 2001By ROBIN ALLEN\\t\\tThere are growing fears that Enron, the US power company, may withdraw or sharply reduce its stake in the Gulf's Dollars 10bn Dolphin gas export scheme, one of the most ambitious of its kind in the region. \\t\\tEnron officials have refused to comment on reports that the company is reconsidering its position as a minority shareholder in Dolphin Energy, in which France's TotalFinaElf (TFE) also has 24.5 per cent. \\t\\tHowever, one industry specialist said yesterday Enron was talking of \"selling\" at least part of its shareholding. \\t\\tThe threat raises critical issues for western companies seeking to profit from accessing state-owned oil and gas in the Gulf. \\t\\tThe project was launched two years ago by Abu Dhabi, the wealthiest of the United Arab Emirates, to promote energy security for the Gulf. But Abu Dhabiis seen as a prime example of a state where prestige and opaque domestic political considerations can be as important as profitability in such a large-scale project, especially in the early stages. \\t\\tDolphin's majority owner is UAE's Offsets Group (UOG), an offshoot of Abu Dhabi's defence procurement industry. In March, Dolphin, a relative newcomer on Abu Dhabi's energy scene, signed a Dollars 3.5bn agreement with Qatar to exploit and pipe up to 2bn cubic feet a day of gas from Qatar's prolific North Field to Abu Dhabi. \\t\\tQatari gas is the source of Abu Dhabi's long-term energy strategy, and Enron's role was to develop, at a profit, the downstream section, primarily to construct and lay the 350km pipeline from Qatar to Abu Dhabi. \\t\\tEnron is not a specialist in energy production or pipeline fabrication, but one of its main aims, according to one analyst, was to gain access to the gas accruing to it from the Qatar deal and then trade it on.

But he said these factors were not sufficient to explain Japan's high electricity rates. A report commissioned by Enron Japan Corp showed that in 1998 Japan's electricity rates for industrial users were 16.81 yen per kilowatt hour (kWh) compared to a second highest rate of 12.44 yen in Italy. Japan's business sector has expressed concern at the nation's high electricity rates, saying that it blunts their competitive edge on the international market. Kean also drew parallels between Japan, in the midst of deregulation, and California which has been suffering from a power shortage since deregulating its market in 1998. These included the length of time that authorities in Japan took to issue permits to allow the construction of new power plants, he said. \"The regulatory structure in Japan is very strict...just like in California,\" Kean said. North America's biggest buyer and seller of electricity, Enron gained its first foothold in Japan in 1999 when it established affiliate E Power Corp. In April of last year, it set up subsidiary Enron Japan Corp. Kean urged Japan to step up measures to open up its power market, a process he said held many benefits. Japan is in the process of deregulating its power market. Since March last year, large-lot consumers have been free to chose their suppliers. The measure liberalised an estimated 30 percent of the power market and ended Japan's 10 power utilities regional monopoly. However, industry watchers note that there have been very few new entrants and that further deregulation measures must be taken for rates to fall. The Japanese government is due to review the process in 2003.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Japan Must Speed Up Pwr Sector Dereg To Lower Rates-Indus05/15/2001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)TOKYO -(Dow Jones)- Japan should accelerate the ongoing electric power sector deregulation to fully liberalize the retail market, in order to bring down the country's high power rates while ensuring stable power supply, experts said at an industry seminar Tuesday. The pressure is mounting for Japan's 10 power utilities, which have long enjoyed regional monopolies until a year ago, to become cost- effective and performance-conscious after the government partially liberalized the retail power market in March 2000.However, the current scheme has so far failed to lure a large number of potential entrants because of the high transmission fees they must pay to conventional power companies. \"What happened in overseas (power industries) suggest that the liberalization in Japan wouldn't only lower power rates but would also contribute to stable power supply significantly,\" said Tatsuo Hatta, professor of economics at the University of Tokyo. Compared with the U.S., Japanese electricity charges are typically twice as much for households and three times higher for industrial users. \"There is a large discrepancy (in rates), and that is why we should hurriedly implement the liberalization,\" Hatta said. He said Japan's steep seasonal peak-load curve - one of the reasons the power companies cite as the cause of high power rates in Japan - can be altered once the prices are liberalized. \"If power rates are set higher during those peak hours following the liberalization, users would refrain from using electricity.\" Steven Kean, executive vice president of the U.S. energy major, Enron Corp. (ENE), told the same seminar that Japan's power costs remain on the upward trend despite cost reductions in Europe and the U.S. He said Japan could achieve a cost-saving of Y4 trillion a year if its power prices fall to levels in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries following the liberalization. Hatta and Kean were speaking at the seminar called \"Reassessing Power Deregulation,\" which was co-sponsored by the Houston-based Enron. Hatta of the University of Tokyo said \"it's very wise\" that Japan has begun the deregulation with the \"bilateral supply, or trade\" system under which suppliers and users clinch deals directly. Under the current reforms, the sector for high-volume, large-lot industrial and commercial users - which represents only 30% of the Y15 trillion market - is opened to free competition. The government is to review the partial deregulation by 2003 for further deregulation. Japan should then introduce spot electricity trading such as futures and derivatives to alleviate risks of complicated price volatility for power providers, Hatta said. Hatta and other experts attending the seminar said further deregulation should destroy the systems that have supported the country's high power rates - regional monopolies and the fair rate return method, under which all costs are levied on prices. \"There is absolutely no need to set the same (power) prices\" nationwide, Hatta said. Power companies should make the opaque transmission fees transparent and set them accordingly with regional demand, he said. Yoshinori Omuro, vice president of Takashimaya Co.'s (J.TKA or 8233) management department, acknowledged the slow progress of the deregulation. Takashimaya, a major department store operator, has shifted to Diamond Power Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mitsubishi Corp. (J.MIB or 8058) as its power supplier at two of its 18 stores, with \"strong back-up\" from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. \"Despite the deregulation, the situation isn't where we can negotiate with power utilities to reduce (electricity costs). We have no choice but select independent power providers,\" Omuro said. -By Maki Aoto, Dow Jones Newswires; 813-5255-2929; maki.aoto@dowjones.comCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

SINGAPORE: ANALYSIS-No Asia fallout seen from Enron's India woes.By Cameron Dueck05/15/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.SINGAPORE, May 15 (Reuters) - A bitter payment battle between U.S. energy giant Enron Corp and authorities in India will serve as a reminder to foreign investors of the risks of putting money into emerging markets, analysts and bankers say. But it is unlikely to deter the flow of money into Asian electricity projects.The pace of power privatisation and deregulation varies too greatly from country to country for the controversy in India to chill investment activity across Asia, they say. It does, however, underline the risks companies take despite some security offered by government payment guarantees. \"Independant power producers (IPPs) will see Enron and Dabhol as an illustration of the dangers and possible risks of investing in an emerging market, but it would be going too far to say that other markets will be adversely affected because of it,\" said Philip Jackson, a banker with JP Morgan Chase in Hong Kong. Enron is on the verge of bailing out of an almost completed $2.9 billion power project because of a decade-long dispute with the troubled Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) over pricing and unpaid bills. MSEB has fallen about six months behind in paying for electricity supplied by Dabhol Power Co, the Indian unit of Houston-based Enron. The utility said last month that it had repaid about $28.6 million of the $48.2 million outstanding. The board of Dabhol has authorised the management to stop selling power to MSEB if the dispute is not resolved. Local media reports earlier in May said Enron was pulling executives out of India and relocating them elsewhere. Dabhol has invoked payment guarantees issued by the state and federal governments, but neither has stepped forward to foot the bill. GOVERNMENT GUARANTEES Banks often demand sponsor or host government guarantees to lessen risk before financing energy projects, which have long lead times and high capital expenditure. Governments are keen to provide guarantees to attract foreign investment. Guarantees may cover shortfalls in production, default of customer payment or even changes in market conditions. But such guarantees do not always provide the desired safety net and analysts said the legal systems in many emerging nations are simply not efficient enough to back these agreements. Enron's experience in India highlighted the risks of power investment in emerging countries and the unpredictability of government guarantees, they said. \"Guarantees like that are painful for companies and for polititicians they're even more so,\" said John Vautrain, vice president at Purvin & Gertz in Singapore. \"If the call is substantial, it's going to be bad.\" Robert Booth, director of the Bardak Group in West Perth, Australia, was more pessimistic and reckoned some companies might take a lead from Enron and shy away from emerging Asian nations. \"Investors will pull back from these countries until they see that there is a properly functioning legal system that gives them assurance if they have to call in a government guarantee,\" Booth said.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Saudi Won't Announce Winners Of Gas Projs Tue - Report05/15/2001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)MANAMA, Bahrain -(Dow Jones)- Saudi Arabia's supreme petroleum council is expected to hold a meeting Tuesday evening, but it's unlikely to declare its choice of international oil companies to participate in downstream gas projects, Arabic al-Hayat newspaper reported. The newspaper quoted sources at the government's technical committee overseeing the proposed projects as saying that the committee hasn't completed its final report concerning the oil companies' offers.\"Studies and recommendations haven't been completed yet and they need some time in order to present the project at its final structure, attached with recommendations from the technical committee,\" the sources said, according to the newspaper. However, the oil council \"might endorse some balances concerning the offers,\" the newspaper said but didn't elaborate further. Sources in Saudi Arabia have said the oil companies were expected to be notified soon on whether they have been selected to participate in the gas projects. Saudi Arabia invited international oil companies in October 1998 to participate in proposals for downstream gas projects and upstream gas enhancement.

Saudi Supreme Petrol Council meeting to decide on huge gas project bids05/15/2001Business RecorderCopyright (C) 2001 Business Recorder; Source: World Reporter (TM)RIYADH : Saudi Arabia's Supreme Petroleum Council (SPC) is holding meetings on bids by 12 foreign oil majors for three giant gas projects and should take a decision shortly, a top oil official said on Monday. \"The SPC has been discussing recommendations by the negotiating committee about the bids, and the meetings will continues executive president of the committee Abdulrahman al-Suhaibani told AFP. \"It is not clear yet when the discussions will be completed and wham a final decision will be issued,\" added Suhaibani, who expected it to be soon. The meetings began two weeks ago.A senior foreign oil executive in the kingdom expected an answer to his firm's bid by the end of this week or the start of next week. \"The SPC is holding a crucial meeting today (Monday) and tomorrow. bin were told we would get an answer to our proposals either this weekend or early next week,\" the executive told AFP. The negotiating committee made detailed recommendations after meeting with the representative of 12 international oil companies (IOCs) which are bidding for the three multi-billion projects, the executive said. The committee, comprising ministers who are also SPC members, is headed by Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal. The gas projects, which would be the first foreign investment in the kingdom's energy sector since nationalisation in 1961, are located in the South Ghawar field near Al-Hufuf in the Eastern Province, Shaybah in the Empty Quarter desert, and the northern Red Sea area. They cover 440,000 square kilometres (176,000 square miles), making it the world's largest area for hydrocarbon investment. US majors Enron and Occidental in a joint bid, as well as Chevron, Conocokilometres, ExxonMobil, Marathon, Phillips and Texaco have been shortlisted for the Saudi projects. Rounding out the list are European firms BP Amoco, Eni, Royal Dutch Shell and TotalFinaElf. ExxonMobil, Shell and TotalFinaElf are in the bidding for all three ventures. The investment involves gas exploration and production, setting up petrochemical industries and power and water desalination plants. The projects, called the natural gas initiative, are to be carried out simultaneously by consortia of two to three firms in cooperation with Aramco, the national oil company, on long-term basis for up to 30 years, the executive said. Aramco has been working to double the Saudi gas network's capacity from the current 3.5 billion cubic feet (105 million cubic metres) per day to seven billion cubic feet (210 million metres) daily in 2004. Saudi Arabia, which sits on top of the world's biggest oil reserves, has proven natural gas reserves of 220 trillion cubic feet (6.6 trillion cubic metres).-AFPCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

City Council soon will receive the contract for its approval. The administration of Mayor Lee Brown was believed to have favored Montgomery Watson's chief competitor, Azurix Corp., an arm of local energy giant Enron Corp. The water corporation, known as \"the Hawk,\" voted 5-0 to grant the contract. If approved by City Council, the contract would give the company 2 1/2 years to get the plant up and treating raw lake water. It was initially expected that the plant, which will be designed to handle 40 million gallons of water daily, could cost as much as $150 million to build. The Hawk board asked the vying companies to modify their bids several times, and that caused the competitors to lower their prices. The contract calls for the Hawk to pay a monthly operating fee of $157,000 when the plant is working. And Montgomery Watson could be required to construct, at the Hawk's option, an additional 40 million-gallon-a-day plant expansion for $32 million. But the details of how the plant will be financed have not been determined. The Hawk board discussed borrowing money using the city's credit rating on a short-term basis until it could develop long-term financing by selling bonds itself. The initial customer for the water is the city of Houston, which would repay the Hawk the cost of producing the treated water. The hope is that the plant eventually will provide water to other entities in the area as well. This plant is part of an area plan for the treatment of surface water that could cost about $2 billion to implement. City Councilman Carroll Robinson, who heads the council infrastructure committee, said he expects to hold two hearings about the contract. One would focus on how the Hawk board picked Montgomery Watson. A series of three recommendations from City Hall staff recommended Azurix. Hawk board members said Montgomery Watson's prices were lower by millions and that Azurix plans to sell Azurix North America, the body that would oversee this contract. The second City Council hearing will focus on financing, Robinson said. \"In my mind, how the city will pay for this construction is as important as who will do it,\" Robinson said. The Hawk board, appointed by Brown and approved by City Council, has been heavily lobbied by the contenders for the job. Because City Council does not have to follow the Hawk recommendation, new pressure has begun at City Hall. The third bidder, U.S. Filter Operating Services, part of a French company, has been heavily lobbying some council members to switch the contract to it. Some members of the Azurix team -- people at companies that would have gotten work had Azurix gotten the job -- have written letters complaining about the Hawk procedures as well. John M. Stokes, president and chief executive officer of Azurix, penned the first such distressed missive. In April, he wrote to Hawk board Chairman David Berg complaining of the \"deleterious economic effect\" on Azurix of the board's decision to negotiate with Montgomery Watson. He requested that Berg answer a series of questions in writing explaining why Azurix didn't get the job. Berg didn't do so. Although that letter had a threatening tone, Amanda Martin, president of Azurix North America, said no threat was intended and the letter simply indicated how upset the team was when it first learned Azurix wasn't chosen. Azurix was the rumored front-runner for months. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tINTERNATIONAL ECONOMY: Enron may cut stake in Gulf gas project Financial Times; May 15, 2001By ROBIN ALLEN\\t\\tThere are growing fears that Enron, the US power company, may withdraw or sharply reduce its stake in the Gulf's Dollars 10bn Dolphin gas export scheme, one of the most ambitious of its kind in the region. \\t\\tEnron officials have refused to comment on reports that the company is reconsidering its position as a minority shareholder in Dolphin Energy, in which France's TotalFinaElf (TFE) also has 24.5 per cent. \\t\\tHowever, one industry specialist said yesterday Enron was talking of \"selling\" at least part of its shareholding. \\t\\tThe threat raises critical issues for western companies seeking to profit from accessing state-owned oil and gas in the Gulf. \\t\\tThe project was launched two years ago by Abu Dhabi, the wealthiest of the United Arab Emirates, to promote energy security for the Gulf. But Abu Dhabiis seen as a prime example of a state where prestige and opaque domestic political considerations can be as important as profitability in such a large-scale project, especially in the early stages. \\t\\tDolphin's majority owner is UAE's Offsets Group (UOG), an offshoot of Abu Dhabi's defence procurement industry. In March, Dolphin, a relative newcomer on Abu Dhabi's energy scene, signed a Dollars 3.5bn agreement with Qatar to exploit and pipe up to 2bn cubic feet a day of gas from Qatar's prolific North Field to Abu Dhabi. \\t\\tQatari gas is the source of Abu Dhabi's long-term energy strategy, and Enron's role was to develop, at a profit, the downstream section, primarily to construct and lay the 350km pipeline from Qatar to Abu Dhabi. \\t\\tEnron is not a specialist in energy production or pipeline fabrication, but one of its main aims, according to one analyst, was to gain access to the gas accruing to it from the Qatar deal and then trade it on.

But he said these factors were not sufficient to explain Japan's high electricity rates. A report commissioned by Enron Japan Corp showed that in 1998 Japan's electricity rates for industrial users were 16.81 yen per kilowatt hour (kWh) compared to a second highest rate of 12.44 yen in Italy. Japan's business sector has expressed concern at the nation's high electricity rates, saying that it blunts their competitive edge on the international market. Kean also drew parallels between Japan, in the midst of deregulation, and California which has been suffering from a power shortage since deregulating its market in 1998. These included the length of time that authorities in Japan took to issue permits to allow the construction of new power plants, he said. \"The regulatory structure in Japan is very strict...just like in California,\" Kean said. North America's biggest buyer and seller of electricity, Enron gained its first foothold in Japan in 1999 when it established affiliate E Power Corp. In April of last year, it set up subsidiary Enron Japan Corp. Kean urged Japan to step up measures to open up its power market, a process he said held many benefits. Japan is in the process of deregulating its power market. Since March last year, large-lot consumers have been free to chose their suppliers. The measure liberalised an estimated 30 percent of the power market and ended Japan's 10 power utilities regional monopoly. However, industry watchers note that there have been very few new entrants and that further deregulation measures must be taken for rates to fall. The Japanese government is due to review the process in 2003.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Japan Must Speed Up Pwr Sector Dereg To Lower Rates-Indus05/15/2001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)TOKYO -(Dow Jones)- Japan should accelerate the ongoing electric power sector deregulation to fully liberalize the retail market, in order to bring down the country's high power rates while ensuring stable power supply, experts said at an industry seminar Tuesday. The pressure is mounting for Japan's 10 power utilities, which have long enjoyed regional monopolies until a year ago, to become cost- effective and performance-conscious after the government partially liberalized the retail power market in March 2000.However, the current scheme has so far failed to lure a large number of potential entrants because of the high transmission fees they must pay to conventional power companies. \"What happened in overseas (power industries) suggest that the liberalization in Japan wouldn't only lower power rates but would also contribute to stable power supply significantly,\" said Tatsuo Hatta, professor of economics at the University of Tokyo. Compared with the U.S., Japanese electricity charges are typically twice as much for households and three times higher for industrial users. \"There is a large discrepancy (in rates), and that is why we should hurriedly implement the liberalization,\" Hatta said. He said Japan's steep seasonal peak-load curve - one of the reasons the power companies cite as the cause of high power rates in Japan - can be altered once the prices are liberalized. \"If power rates are set higher during those peak hours following the liberalization, users would refrain from using electricity.\" Steven Kean, executive vice president of the U.S. energy major, Enron Corp. (ENE), told the same seminar that Japan's power costs remain on the upward trend despite cost reductions in Europe and the U.S. He said Japan could achieve a cost-saving of Y4 trillion a year if its power prices fall to levels in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries following the liberalization. Hatta and Kean were speaking at the seminar called \"Reassessing Power Deregulation,\" which was co-sponsored by the Houston-based Enron. Hatta of the University of Tokyo said \"it's very wise\" that Japan has begun the deregulation with the \"bilateral supply, or trade\" system under which suppliers and users clinch deals directly. Under the current reforms, the sector for high-volume, large-lot industrial and commercial users - which represents only 30% of the Y15 trillion market - is opened to free competition. The government is to review the partial deregulation by 2003 for further deregulation. Japan should then introduce spot electricity trading such as futures and derivatives to alleviate risks of complicated price volatility for power providers, Hatta said. Hatta and other experts attending the seminar said further deregulation should destroy the systems that have supported the country's high power rates - regional monopolies and the fair rate return method, under which all costs are levied on prices. \"There is absolutely no need to set the same (power) prices\" nationwide, Hatta said. Power companies should make the opaque transmission fees transparent and set them accordingly with regional demand, he said. Yoshinori Omuro, vice president of Takashimaya Co.'s (J.TKA or 8233) management department, acknowledged the slow progress of the deregulation. Takashimaya, a major department store operator, has shifted to Diamond Power Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mitsubishi Corp. (J.MIB or 8058) as its power supplier at two of its 18 stores, with \"strong back-up\" from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. \"Despite the deregulation, the situation isn't where we can negotiate with power utilities to reduce (electricity costs). We have no choice but select independent power providers,\" Omuro said. -By Maki Aoto, Dow Jones Newswires; 813-5255-2929; maki.aoto@dowjones.comCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

SINGAPORE: ANALYSIS-No Asia fallout seen from Enron's India woes.By Cameron Dueck05/15/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.SINGAPORE, May 15 (Reuters) - A bitter payment battle between U.S. energy giant Enron Corp and authorities in India will serve as a reminder to foreign investors of the risks of putting money into emerging markets, analysts and bankers say. But it is unlikely to deter the flow of money into Asian electricity projects.The pace of power privatisation and deregulation varies too greatly from country to country for the controversy in India to chill investment activity across Asia, they say. It does, however, underline the risks companies take despite some security offered by government payment guarantees. \"Independant power producers (IPPs) will see Enron and Dabhol as an illustration of the dangers and possible risks of investing in an emerging market, but it would be going too far to say that other markets will be adversely affected because of it,\" said Philip Jackson, a banker with JP Morgan Chase in Hong Kong. Enron is on the verge of bailing out of an almost completed $2.9 billion power project because of a decade-long dispute with the troubled Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) over pricing and unpaid bills. MSEB has fallen about six months behind in paying for electricity supplied by Dabhol Power Co, the Indian unit of Houston-based Enron. The utility said last month that it had repaid about $28.6 million of the $48.2 million outstanding. The board of Dabhol has authorised the management to stop selling power to MSEB if the dispute is not resolved. Local media reports earlier in May said Enron was pulling executives out of India and relocating them elsewhere. Dabhol has invoked payment guarantees issued by the state and federal governments, but neither has stepped forward to foot the bill. GOVERNMENT GUARANTEES Banks often demand sponsor or host government guarantees to lessen risk before financing energy projects, which have long lead times and high capital expenditure. Governments are keen to provide guarantees to attract foreign investment. Guarantees may cover shortfalls in production, default of customer payment or even changes in market conditions. But such guarantees do not always provide the desired safety net and analysts said the legal systems in many emerging nations are simply not efficient enough to back these agreements. Enron's experience in India highlighted the risks of power investment in emerging countries and the unpredictability of government guarantees, they said. \"Guarantees like that are painful for companies and for polititicians they're even more so,\" said John Vautrain, vice president at Purvin & Gertz in Singapore. \"If the call is substantial, it's going to be bad.\" Robert Booth, director of the Bardak Group in West Perth, Australia, was more pessimistic and reckoned some companies might take a lead from Enron and shy away from emerging Asian nations. \"Investors will pull back from these countries until they see that there is a properly functioning legal system that gives them assurance if they have to call in a government guarantee,\" Booth said.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Saudi Won't Announce Winners Of Gas Projs Tue - Report05/15/2001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)MANAMA, Bahrain -(Dow Jones)- Saudi Arabia's supreme petroleum council is expected to hold a meeting Tuesday evening, but it's unlikely to declare its choice of international oil companies to participate in downstream gas projects, Arabic al-Hayat newspaper reported. The newspaper quoted sources at the government's technical committee overseeing the proposed projects as saying that the committee hasn't completed its final report concerning the oil companies' offers.\"Studies and recommendations haven't been completed yet and they need some time in order to present the project at its final structure, attached with recommendations from the technical committee,\" the sources said, according to the newspaper. However, the oil council \"might endorse some balances concerning the offers,\" the newspaper said but didn't elaborate further. Sources in Saudi Arabia have said the oil companies were expected to be notified soon on whether they have been selected to participate in the gas projects. Saudi Arabia invited international oil companies in October 1998 to participate in proposals for downstream gas projects and upstream gas enhancement.
