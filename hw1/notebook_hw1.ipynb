What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this project.I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been good.

We've had three meetings which brought out very different issues from different traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to be outside the scope of position consolidation.Things left to do:I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this project.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this project and which fall out of scope.For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and work with traders to define the exact requirements of each.Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all drill downs.Use the above to formulate a project plan.Things requested thus far (no particular order):Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal ticker.Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that add up existing position manager rows/columns).New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, transport, swaps, options, ...Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values of all curves on which the desk has a position.Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the appropriate positions to show for each:Gas Daily for monthly index,Physical gas for Nymex,Physical gas for Inside Ferc,Physical gas for Mid market.Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of using official valuations.Position and P&amp;L aggregation across all gas desks.Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS:Inclusion of spread options in our systems.

Crocker\" &lt;clclegal2@aol.com&gt; Subject: Investment StructureSTRUCTURE:Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries theliability of construction.LAND OWNERSHIP &amp; LOANSThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership andany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be inthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors andall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee theloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profitsis reduced.All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, arefull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse.USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENTThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &amp;architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlikemany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees toCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred overthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimatedmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds.The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint.CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans forpre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  willbe from 80% to 95% of value.DISBURSEMENTSDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current andnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partnerwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and thefee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, orcannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake thisfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not ownany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.REPORTINGWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet basedreporting.BOOKKEEPINGI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, \"Bookkeepingprocedures to record actual expenses?\"  Please expand.INVESTOR INPUTWe are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As alwaysthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in myexperience I have always been able to reach consensus.

We've had three meetings which brought out very different issues from different traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to be outside the scope of position consolidation.Things left to do:I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this project.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this project and which fall out of scope.For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and work with traders to define the exact requirements of each.Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all drill downs.Use the above to formulate a project plan.Things requested thus far (no particular order):Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal ticker.Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that add up existing position manager rows/columns).New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, transport, swaps, options, ...Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values of all curves on which the desk has a position.Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the appropriate positions to show for each:Gas Daily for monthly index,Physical gas for Nymex,Physical gas for Inside Ferc,Physical gas for Mid market.Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of using official valuations.Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks.Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS:Inclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility skew and correlations.Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.  Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a gamma grid.Valuation of Gas Daily options.A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD.Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets.Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position manager.Ability to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker.  Show new deal terms, prior deal terms, and net P&L affect of the change.Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker.Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of individual deals on the position total in a grid cell.Benchmark positions in TDS.Deployment of TDS in Canada. Currency and volume uom conversions. Implicit and explicit position break out issues.-- Allan.PS: Colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for transport.

Crocker\" <clclegal2@aol.com> Subject: Investment StructureSTRUCTURE:Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries theliability of construction.LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANSThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership andany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be inthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors andall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee theloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profitsis reduced.All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, arefull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse.USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENTThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlikemany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees toCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred overthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimatedmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds.The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint.CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans forpre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  willbe from 80% to 95% of value.DISBURSEMENTSDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current andnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partnerwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and thefee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, orcannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake thisfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not ownany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.REPORTINGWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.What did you have in mind?

The FERC has made itclear that ISO does not have the ability to mandate that generators sell to ISO at its price caps and that the proper response to inadequate supply is to lift the price caps.On Friday, the FERC issued its Order on Complaint in connection with the July 10 complaint filed by Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. (\"MS\").  As you may recall, MS requested FERC to issue a stay of the ISO's maximum purchase price authority and to direct the ISO to reverse any price cap reductions.  MS sought Fast Track processing pursuant to Rule 206(h), which was granted by FERC on the grounds that the complaint \"warrants expeditious action.\"As a quick background summary for you, last November, FERC issued an order approving Tariff Amendment 21 which extended ISO's price cap authority through 11/15/00.  That order stated that the ISO \"maximum purchase price was not a cap on what the seller may charge the ISO, but a cap on what the ISO was willing to pay.\"  The Commission said that sellers dissatisfied with the price cap could \"choose to sell those services into the California Power Exchange or bilateral markets.\"FERC notes in Friday's Order that the 6/28 the ISO's Board resolution lowered the caps to $500 and ISO further directed that, \"To the extent permitted by law, regulation and pre-existing contract, Management shall direct generators to bid in all their capacity when system load exceeds 38,000 MW.\"The MS complaint alleged that the cap reduction was unlawful and would, \"threaten the stability and integroty of the marketplace.\"  MS also requested an emergency technical conference to examine ISO's justification for the price cap reduction.FERC denied the MS stay request, as well as its request that the $750 maximum purchase price be reinstated.  The Commission reiterates that it is not approving a cap on sellers' prices, because they can sell at whatever price they want.  Rather ISO has simply stated the maximum price it is willing to pay.  \"Because sellers are not required to sell to the ISO, the ISO cannot dictate their price.\"Importantly, however, FERC also states that, \"ISO has no more or less ability to procure capacity and energy than any other buyer of these services....if the ISO is unable to elicit sufficient supplies at or below its announced purchase price ceiling (because generators are free to sell elsewhere if they choose), it will have to raise its purchase price to the level necessary to meet its needs.\"  [Emphasis added]  FERC then notes that this may lead to an increase in Out of Market (\"OOM\") calls and that OOM calls are not subject to a maximum purchase price.Also, with regard to the ISO's resolution stating that generators must bid their capacity into the ISO markets when system load exceeds 38,000 MW, FERC states clearly that, \"such a requirement is not permitted by our November  12 Order and the ISO tariff.\"  [Emphasis added]FERC goes on to say that any requirement to sell to ISO in conjunction with a maximum purchase price would require significant revisions to ISO's market rules, which could not be made effective without a corresponding amendment to ISO's tariff.  This would require 60 days' advance notice, \"and could not be implemented prior to Commission approval.  As stated above, our November 12 Order was clearly based on the premise that the proper response to inadequate supply (due to a low maximum purchase price) is to raise the maximum purchase price.\"ISO is then \"put on notice that any amendment to mandate sales must be accompanied by a demonstration that this extreme measure is the proper response to low supplies in the ISO markets.\"Concurrences were filed by Commissioners Massey and Hebert.  Massey suggests that the state has to facilitate solutions to market issues, such as risk management tools, removing constraints on hedging opportunities, introducing real time pricing through real time metering and expediting approval of new generation and transmission projects in California.  Hebert says that the previous November Order tried to \"straddle the fence\" and that, \"Today, the Commission at least starts to lean slightly in the right direction of recognizing that we have a role.\"  He then reiterates his preference for removing all price caps.  He also suggests that, \"Getting to the bottom of the problem, in my view, requires us to begin a proceeding to rescind our approval of the ISO as operator of the California grid.  The record supports such a move.\"  He refers approvingly to the Collins resignation letter, stating that it, \"thoughtfully outlines consequences to the market of a return to 'command and control.' \"  Hebert states that, \"The independence of the ISO's governing structure stands threatened.  We should 'stand up,' to quote the resignation letter.\"  Hebert advocates opening a section 206 proceeding now, as part of the recently announced inquiry into bulk power markets, \"including the California markets.\"This decision makes it clear that ISO cannot lower the caps at tomorrow's meeting and expect that sellers will be required to sell to it at that price.  This is an important development and very good news in our ongoing efforts to seek economic sanity at the ISO.Please call if you have any questions.Dan\n",

       "1    Jeff,As of Dec 14th, Enron received the message regarding David Spurlin greater involvement in the EBS relationship.   In the past, EBS had included David on the direction of our relationship and not the details.   Our prior direction was to have Derrick Deakins as our key point of communication.   In regards to your comment about amending the Agreement.   I would like to fill yourself, David and Bob in on some history.   During the meetings in August 2000,  EBS and Compaq reviewed the Agreement line by line and identified 5 sections to be clarified / amended.  There was a group of at least 8 Compaq attendees (Chris Sweet took extensive notes for Compaq).  Both EBS and Compaq agreed on the methodology to calculate the value of the Compaq Minimum Annual Spend of EBS Services.   Spreadsheets were exchanged between both Parties and the amounts were agreed upon.   A significant amount of time was spent in this process between August through October.   EBS and Compaq (Derrick Deakins) developed contract language to clarify the outstanding 5 sections.   This contract amendment was sent to Compaq (Rob and Derrick) for comments in November.   EBS has not heard anything regarding the language.  During the course of these discussions, EBS agreed to concede on certain points of interpretation on the Server Purchase Agreement and Compaq agreed to work with EBS to achieve revenue recognition in 2000.   The EBS concessions were used by both Parties to develop the methodology to calculate the Compaq Minimum Spend toward EBS Services.  This was reason for the development of the EBS Consulting Payment ($832,000).   EBS looks forward to the resolution of these issues and moving forward with our relationship.Kim GodfreyDirector, Enterprise ServicesEnron Broadband Servicesphone : 713 345 8813cell :      713 501 8105fax:        713 853 7354\\tJeff.Gooden@compaq.com\\t12/18/00 07:58 PM\\t\\t \\t\\t To: Kim Godfrey/Enron Communications@Enron Communications\\t\\t cc: \\t\\t Subject: RE: Compaq / EBS Relationship Kim,Thank you for including me in this email...I agree, without question, DaveSpurlin \"Owns\" the Enron/Compaq relationship, from Compaq's perspective.All matters should go through Dave...Thank you, this will make your lifeeasier.Although I was not in the entire meeting with yourself, Keith and Rob; Myreaction was that this agreement needs to be amended to protect both Enronand Compaq.

EBS has identified potential server business opportunities(storage, streaming media) where our two organizations can work together.Afterour meeting on Dec 14th, EBS now understands to utilize David Spurlin as thepoint person for these communications.  EBS had prior direction from Compaqtodirect our discussions to Derrick Deakins, Rob Senders, Keith McAuliffe orKentMajor.  Tracy Prater and myself look forward to spending additional timewithDavid to ensure that he is aware of the EBS business opportunities andissues.EBS had invested significant dollars, time and energy with Compaq to developthestreaming media server solutions.  We discussed during the Dec 14th meetingthatthere are decisions to be made regarding the existing Product and ServerSupplyAgreement that are contingent on those streaming media solutions.  EBS andCompaq have both acted in good faith to achieve the intent of the ProductandServer Supply Agreement in pursuing these solutions.  To that end, EBS hashadinternal discussions regarding the appropriate next steps to further ourrelationship.The January 2000 Product and Service Supply Agreement is the legal frameworkforour relationship until both parties mutually agree to change.  Until thosechanges are made:1) 2000 Compaq Annual Purchase of ECI Services:  Per the Agreement, Compaqwasinvoiced for the 2000 Minimum Annual Purchase of ECI Services on November 7,2000 as per Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3.  Compaq had agreed  to the invoiceamount.  EBS expects payment for the total invoice as outlined in Section3.0 onor before December 31,2000.2) Potential for Agreement Termination:  Prior to the Dec 14th meeting,Compaq(Keith and Rob) have discussed this with EBS (Jim Crowder, myself).

       "1    Jeff,As of Dec 14th, Enron received the message regarding David Spurlin greater involvement in the EBS relationship.   In the past, EBS had included David on the direction of our relationship and not the details.   Our prior direction was to have Derrick Deakins as our key point of communication.   In regards to your comment about amending the Agreement.   I would like to fill yourself, David and Bob in on some history.   During the meetings in August 2000,  EBS and Compaq reviewed the Agreement line by line and identified 5 sections to be clarified / amended.  There was a group of at least 8 Compaq attendees (Chris Sweet took extensive notes for Compaq).  Both EBS and Compaq agreed on the methodology to calculate the value of the Compaq Minimum Annual Spend of EBS Services.   Spreadsheets were exchanged between both Parties and the amounts were agreed upon.   A significant amount of time was spent in this process between August through October.   EBS and Compaq (Derrick Deakins) developed contract language to clarify the outstanding 5 sections.   This contract amendment was sent to Compaq (Rob and Derrick) for comments in November.   EBS has not heard anything regarding the language.  During the course of these discussions, EBS agreed to concede on certain points of interpretation on the Server Purchase Agreement and Compaq agreed to work with EBS to achieve revenue recognition in 2000.   The EBS concessions were used by both Parties to develop the methodology to calculate the Compaq Minimum Spend toward EBS Services.  This was reason for the development of the EBS Consulting Payment ($832,000).   EBS looks forward to the resolution of these issues and moving forward with our relationship.Kim GodfreyDirector, Enterprise ServicesEnron Broadband Servicesphone : 713 345 8813cell :      713 501 8105fax:        713 853 7354\\tJeff.Gooden@compaq.com\\t12/18/00 07:58 PM\\t\\t \\t\\t To: Kim Godfrey/Enron Communications@Enron Communications\\t\\t cc: \\t\\t Subject: RE: Compaq / EBS Relationship Kim,Thank you for including me in this email...I agree, without question, DaveSpurlin \"Owns\" the Enron/Compaq relationship, from Compaq's perspective.All matters should go through Dave...Thank you, this will make your lifeeasier.Although I was not in the entire meeting with yourself, Keith and Rob; Myreaction was that this agreement needs to be amended to protect both Enronand Compaq.

EBS has identified potential server business opportunities(storage, streaming media) where our two organizations can work together.Afterour meeting on Dec 14th, EBS now understands to utilize David Spurlin as thepoint person for these communications.  EBS had prior direction from Compaqtodirect our discussions to Derrick Deakins, Rob Senders, Keith McAuliffe orKentMajor.  Tracy Prater and myself look forward to spending additional timewithDavid to ensure that he is aware of the EBS business opportunities andissues.EBS had invested significant dollars, time and energy with Compaq to developthestreaming media server solutions.  We discussed during the Dec 14th meetingthatthere are decisions to be made regarding the existing Product and ServerSupplyAgreement that are contingent on those streaming media solutions.  EBS andCompaq have both acted in good faith to achieve the intent of the ProductandServer Supply Agreement in pursuing these solutions.  To that end, EBS hashadinternal discussions regarding the appropriate next steps to further ourrelationship.The January 2000 Product and Service Supply Agreement is the legal frameworkforour relationship until both parties mutually agree to change.  Until thosechanges are made:1) 2000 Compaq Annual Purchase of ECI Services:  Per the Agreement, Compaqwasinvoiced for the 2000 Minimum Annual Purchase of ECI Services on November 7,2000 as per Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3.  Compaq had agreed  to the invoiceamount.  EBS expects payment for the total invoice as outlined in Section3.0 onor before December 31,2000.2) Potential for Agreement Termination:  Prior to the Dec 14th meeting,Compaq(Keith and Rob) have discussed this with EBS (Jim Crowder, myself).   Theunderstanding between both Parties was that EBS would need a written noticeandpayment by Compaq of $2,500,000.  The concept to start over with a newcontractual agreement was again discussed during the Dec 14th meeting.  EBSstrongly believes in the value of the Compaq and EBS relationship, if Compaqbelieves that to start over with a new agreement is necessary then we lookforward to working with Compaq to achieve that goal.Again, we look forward to working with yourselves to identify and createstrategic business opportunities for both EBS and Compaq.Kim GodfreyDirector, Enterprise ServicesEnron Broadband Servicesphone : 713 345 8813cell :      713 501 8105fax:        713 853 7354\n",
